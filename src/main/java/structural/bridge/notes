Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation
so that two can vary independently.


Diff between Strategy & Bridge

Strategy purpose was to dynamically change the behaviour of a class
at runtime without tight coupling the dependency
by encapsulation algo to ts specific class


Bridges purpose is to separate impl and abstraction
and make them grow independently

if in future we have too many  Impl classes with different processes,
it must not affect the abstraction classes.

Concurrency: when a system can have multiple threads in different
stages of execution,but not necessarily making the progress at the same time

this is possible for single core
Core 1: t1 t2 t3 t4
         t1      t2     t3       t1
       -------><----><--------><----->
       t1: 30%
       t2: 40%
       t3: 30%

       Context Switching:
       use scheduler algo 1)Fcfs 2) round robing
Multiple things are happening in the system but not at the same moment
One tacher attending multiple students queries.

 Parallelism: Concurrency + Progress at the same time

 this is possible in multi core cpus
             t1     t2   t4
 cpu 0 :  <------><---><------>
            t3    t1   t5   t2
 cpu 1 :  <----><---><---><------>

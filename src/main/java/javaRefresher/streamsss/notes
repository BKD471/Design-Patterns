step1   create streams from data source(collections)
step2  intermediate ops filter() sorted() map() distinct()
       these transforms streams into another strems and more ops can be performed

step3  terminal ops  like collect() reduce() count() are used
       these ops triggers processing of strems which produces the o/p
       after these ops no ops can be performed

       intermediate ops are lazy coz the stream runs when
       terminal operations is invoked

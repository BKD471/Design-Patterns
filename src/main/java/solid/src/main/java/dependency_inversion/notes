High Level modules should not depend on low level modules
they should depend on abstractions

abstractions should not depend on implementations
implementations should depend on abstraction


Problem:

Class A       Class A should depend on Class B
|             Class B should depend on Class C
|             A knows impl details of B and B knows impl of C
Class B       if there something changes in Impl of C,it will affect B
              and A as well
|
|
Class C


Another problem comes while writing unit tests,
if you want to test CLass A, then you have to mock  Class B
and again CLass C, it creates a chain of dependencies which is hard to manage


when it comes to Dependency Inject, we inject dependencies and not create them
